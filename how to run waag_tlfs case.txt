Introduction 
WaaG TLFS test cases are run under ACRN-UNIT-TEST framework.This repo is the source code of test cases.
And, we have built a binary waag_tlfs.flat,this binary has the waag tlfs test cases code . we can run this binary under SOS shell  by using ./kvm-test.sh waag_tlfs.flat.
if you change the source code, you need rebuild waag_tlfs.flat(pls refer to https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/OTCCWPQA/%5BHypervisor%5D+How+to+run+ACRN-UNIT-TEST to how to build unit-test cases,and how to run unit-test case)

step:
1.Boot SOS (not boot other UOS)
2.enter SOS system , upload ./kvm-test.sh file and waag_tlfs.flat file to SOS 
3.under SOS shell command: run ./kvm-test.sh waag_tlfs.flat (you will see the result on the screen)
